My current research focuses on the ethical, legal, and policy challenges of integrating AI into Arts and Humanities and cultural heritage communities. I seek to emphasize the importance of responsible data documentation and stewardship, along with developing data models and workflows that respect copyright and data privacy. Additionally, I critically examine the intersection of AI and copyright in the research and cultural heritage sector, advocating for policies and practices that balance technological innovation with the ethical and legal imperatives of openness and cultural preservation.​


My goal is to foster a responsible and sustainable AI research culture within the UK's cultural heritage and research communities by promoting informed and ethical AI use.

I have recently co-authored a position paper titled <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/johd.290">"A Position Paper on AI and Copyrights in Cultural Heritage and Research (EU and UK)"</a> with Jörg Lehmann. This publication delves into the debates surrounding the use of copyrighted materials in training machine learning applications, emphasizing the necessity to balance the rights of copyright holders with the advancement of AI technologies in cultural heritage research. 

Furthermore, as part of the Bridging Responsible AI Divides (BRAID) programme, I co-led a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14945987">collective response to the UK Government's consultation on AI and copyright</a>. This response underscores the importance of clear and balanced copyright policies that foster innovation while respecting creators' rights. 

Finally, together with my fantastic colleagues <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/paula-westenberger">Paula Westenberger</a>, <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/harriet-deacon">Harriet Deacon</a>, <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/law/staff/bartolomeomeletti/">Bartolomeo Meletti</a>, and <a href="https://sculecentre.ex.ac.uk/people/andrea-wallace/">Andrea Wallace</a> we have recently inaugurated the new <b>Heritage, Artificial Intelligence & Law (HAIL) Network</b>.  HAIL will be an interdisciplinary space for practitioners, researchers and other advocates in heritage, technology and legal sectors to voice concerns and excitement around the use and development of AI.
