My current research s centers at the changing materialities of the 'archive'. Conceived as "a universal metaphor for all conceivable forms of storage and memory”, archive is a boundary object between old media and new media cultures. My aim is to historicize and explore the technologies, devices, materials, procedures around the archive in the computational environment. By developing an interdisciplinary research framework in the intersection of media theory, archival science, memory studies, media archeology,and digital humanities, my goal is to study archive and archival practices through information architectures, software-based practices and digital storage devices. Furthermore, my research focuses on digital methodologies for born-digital archives such as digital forensics and digital preservation techniques for software-based archival data as a way to approach regimes of memory in digital cultures.

A first approach of my research project was presented at the post-graduate Colloquium of the Department of History and Anthropology of University of Thessaly (Greece) on 5th April 2017 under the title <a href="
