My research focuses on promoting and enabling ethical, open, and sustainable datasets and infrastructures in digital cultural heritage. For those of us working in computationally intensive research contexts, it is essential to make responsible decisions around the management, documentation, and archiving of data, code, and research outputs. At the same time, our choices in responsible computing and ethical practice carry particular weight — especially with the growing use of computationally intensive methods, including AI, in highly complex, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral projects. At the heart of these practices and discussions lies a commitment to the planet, humanity, our communities — and everything in between.


My work in these areas has led to several recent publications 

- <a href="doi.org/10.5334/johd.277">“Datafication and Cultural Heritage Collections Data Infrastructures”</a> in the Journal of Open Data in the Humanities, with my colleagues Arran Rees and Daniel Belteki

- <a href="doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.13683142"> “Ethics as Practice: Report on the 1st Discovery Project Ethics Workshop. Towards a National Collection”</a>, with my fantastic cross-TaNC colleagues Ananda Rutherford, Sara Perry and Katrina Foxton.

- <a href="doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.14006955">“ 'Data Matters': Report on the Towards a National Collection Discovery Projects focus group on data management, documentation, and archiving practices in digital cultural heritage projects”</a> with my colleague Ashley Hawkins, as part of the Towards a National Collection- Congruence Engine project. 

Finally with my colleagues Tasha Kitcher and Max Long we provided a case study for the Digital Humanities Climate Coalition toolkit on  <a href="https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/toolkit/case-studies.html#case-study-4-congruence-engine---raising-environmental-awareness-in-an-interdisciplinary-research-project"> Congruence Engine - raising environmental awareness in an interdisciplinary research project </a>.


Let's try to care more: for our data, our infrastuctures, our communities, our planet.
