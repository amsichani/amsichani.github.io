<a href=""><img src="../images/introDH.jpg" width="800"/></a>

This is an ongoing project that I 've undertaken as part of my research interest on the history/oes of Digital Humanities.
Based on genre pieces and intellectual maps produced by Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities (early and current) practitioners throught the history of the field, I am exploring the development of the field and the vatious approaches between the Humanities and computation technologies.
I am presenting a first draft of this research at the Conference <a href="https://www.rchumanities.gr/psifiakes-anthropistikes-epistimes-s/">«Ψηφιακές Ανθρωπιστικές Επιστήμες στην Ελλάδα: προβληματισμοί και προκλήσεις» (Digital Humanities in Greece )</a>, 16 February 2017.
 Here is a <a herf="">shorthand for the bibliography</a> of the presentation.
