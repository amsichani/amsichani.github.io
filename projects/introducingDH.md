<a href=""><img src="../images/IntroDH.jpg" width="800"/></a>

This is an ongoing project that I 've undertaken as part of my research interest on the history/ies of Digital Humanities as a discipline.
Based on genre pieces and intellectual maps produced by Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities (early and current) practitioners, I am exploring how the field was introduced thoughout its historical development.

I am currently presenting a first draft of this research entitled "Συστήνοντας τα Digital Humanities: Ιστορίες, Γενεαλογίες, Προοπτικές" at the Conference <a href="https://www.rchumanities.gr/psifiakes-anthropistikes-epistimes-s/">«Ψηφιακές Ανθρωπιστικές Επιστήμες στην Ελλάδα: προβληματισμοί και προκλήσεις» (Digital Humanities in Greece )</a> of the <a href="https://www.rchumanities.gr"> Research Center for the Humanities</a>, 16 February 2018.

 Here is a <a href="../images/Bibliography_DH_RCH.pdf"> draft bibliography</a>  and the <a href="../images/RCH_DH.pdf"> slides</a> of my presentation . Stay tuned!
