**Digital Editions of Correspondence material**

Given my strong interest and experience in the digital representation and processing of modern manuscript sources, I am currently working towards a model for the encoding of correspondence material using TEI P5.

Taking into account recent developments within the TEI community such as the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-correspDesc.html">correspDesc</a> extension and the <a href="http://correspsearch.net">CorrespSearch service</a>, I am now collaborating with the CTB team in order to revise the DALF guidelines into a TEI P5 version and to customize them in order to include recent developments and case-specific features of correspondence material. 

To this end, we are using as test-beds several correspondence corpora, such as material from the Archive of Modern Greek Correspondence, a research initiative of the Cultural Foundation of the National Bank of Greece, as well as letters from the Gezelle's.
