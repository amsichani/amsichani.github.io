This is an ongoing project that I 've undertaken as part of my research interest on the history/oes of Digital Humanities.
Based on genre pieces and intellectual maps produced by Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities (early and current) practitioners throught the history of the field, I am exploring the development of the field and the vatious approaches between the Humanities and computation technologies.
I am presenting a first draft of this research at the Conference Digital Humanities in Greece, 16 February 2017.
