Early in 2020 I was awarded a prestigious and competitive <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/anna-maria-sichani"> Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship</a>!  

During this fellowship I am focusing on promoting a comprehensive approach towards research software in Humanities (from developing, reusing, evaluating to integrating and teaching software) through various initiatives, workshops, and communication channels.
More precisely, I am having a dual focus for this fellowship: on the one hand on pedagogy and awareness , in order to further familiarise Humanities scholars with software and programming, and on the other hand on community and policy by actively promoting and  integrating good research software practices & workflows within Digital Humanities structures. Because better understanding & use of software in Digital Humanities results to better research.

In JUly 2019, I organised a first workshop on â€˜Software development in Digital Humanities Projects and Labs at Sussex Humanities Lab, bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and engineers in order to explore how software development principles, workflows, infrastructure can be actively integrated in Digital Humanities environments. There is another series of SSI funded workshops I am putting together for the summer 2021, intended to explore issues of research software's sustainability and training in Humanities environements.

I am excited to join SSI, a supportive and active community of researchers who care about good research software practice, advocate for recognition of software development in research assessment, and are committed to open source values.
