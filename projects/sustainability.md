Human life is (relatively) short but we aim for our digital outputs to live forever and ever.

As part of my DiXiT fellowship, I started to study and work issues on the sustainability and maintenance of Digital Scholarly projects. Because of the nature of digital data and the evolution of both software development and research data management, many of the projects are out of date and no longer supported financially. Of course, sustainability has been always <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwi-0Jym4oHYAhULDMAKHT4ODD4QFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcnx.org%2Fexports%2F01e04a51-0abe-4382-9337-b0089bb23c56%402.pdf%2Fsustainability-the-elephant-in-the-room-2.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3kdjwEAt4XCE0_KrXw3C1C">"the elephant in the room"</a> for DH projects and there are a number of initiatives in this direction eg. from <a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/sites/default/files/reports/4.17.2.pdf">Ithaka </a>.

Several conference presentations and a book chapter are on ther way.
