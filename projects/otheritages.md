Histories, Spaces and Heritages at the transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Greek State is a research project that explores the historical trajectories of urban space from the Ottoman Empire to the modern Greek State. 
The histories and/or ‘stories’ of this shifting urban space are studied in their intersensorial dimension, highlighting the dynamic interplay between materiality and its multifaceted conceptualizations.

I am collaborating with Otheritages project as member of the Digital Humanities Unit. Our main goal is to develop both a methodological model and a computational model for studying the sensory history of Ottoman urban spaces in transition.
To explore the contemporary politics of historical memory as articulated in the Greek and European public sphere, through the opening up of a dialogue with the broader community of professionals and practitioners.
