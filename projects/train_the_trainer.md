As a committed educator and community person, I consider teaching as a life-long journey and a creative way to interact with students. To this end, I am further enhancing my teaching and training skills with both formal teaching qualifications, such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE)(2021), accredited by the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA), which is part of <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship"> AdvanceHE</a>, and offers national and international recognition for the award, as well as through the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Carpentries instructor training scheme</a>, I had completed as part of my Software Sustainability Fellowship (2021). I canâ€™t recommend both schemes enough !

I am also committed to promote and support open, sustainable educational resources in Digital Humanities, working closely with interdisciplinary, multicultural and multilingual audiences.In the past, I held the position of Education manager at <a href="https://programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a> in order to promote PH lessons in and outside of traditional educational settings; now as a ProgHist LtD director I am actively working towards enhancing PH educational provision and capacity both in lessons-resources and in audiences.
