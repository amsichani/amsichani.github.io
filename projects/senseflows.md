<img src="../images/semseflows.jpg" width="500"/>


Senseflows is a case study and pilot project developed as part of the “Histories, Spaces and Heritage” research initiative, funded by the French School at Athens (École Française d’ Athènes). I worked with <a href="http://dimaterialist.net">  Dimitris C.Papadopoulos </a> and the <a href=" http://sonor-cities.edu.gr">Sonor Cities research team</a> to design and develop an Omeka-based digital sensorial archive documenting flows and transformation in urban space at the transition from the Ottoman Empire to the early 20th century Greek state. The project involved data modeling, developing custom metadata fields and terminologies and developing interactive features focusing on the materialities and sensorial qualities of neighborhoods, monuments and objects. 
The “Senselows” website is currently in beta version.
