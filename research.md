# Media(l) changes and literary culture

My PhD research focuses on how changes on textual mediality and communication technologies informed editorial practices and literary activities in the Modern Greek literary field during the Sixties. I am trying to enrich traditional cultural materialism approaches of literary history with medium awareness and to critically problematize traditional concepts of the ‘text’, the ‘archive’ and the ‘edition’ outside the print culture. To this end, the Sixties stands as an emblematic moment in modern society and culture as a period marked by seismic changes in media ecologies, social norms and communicative and cultural practices. By choosing as case study the Greek literary field during the Sixties, I am exploring the ways in which the radio, the discography, the visual culture, the technical advancements in photocopy technology and microfilms inform and radicalise the literary activity and textual scholarship.

By bringing together literary history, media and cultural studies with my digital humanities background and awareness towards communication technologies, publishing and distribution media, I am willing to further historicize the ways that changing materialities of the literary activity and textual scholarship. The advent and use of new – mechanical, electrical and, recently, digital – environments and tools in writing, editing, reading, publishing, discussing literary texts are not a mere evolutionary phenomenon but rather, I argue, challenge and enrich the concept of “change” in literary history beyond aesthetics, thematic, style, genre and generation questions.


#Knowledge and (open) data in the making

My research interest in shifts and transitions expands from the actual object of my primary research (literary culture) to the modes and methods of research and knowledge production itself. Thus, my cross- and interdisciplinary interest and expertise ranges widely, but centres on the changing materialities of literature, knowledge and information making, especially in the digital era, and their related practices and economics. Through my everyday digital humanities academic practice I am experimenting with hands-on-practice and critical reflection on the very nature of the data embedded in various media formats and its further digital representation and processing. My skills and experience include data analysis, architecture and representation, with a specialisation in modern manuscripts sources, encoding and digital publication of textual materials, research data management, sustainability planning and iterative content design.

By trying to comprehensively approach knowledge creation, I am also tracing the  epistemological and methodological transitions in humanities scholarship and scholarly communication. I am a keen advocate of full Open Access and an active supporter of creative ways of knowledge exchange, transfer and collaboration that will ensure that the communication and distribution of research, knowledge and data is fair, ethical, engaging and inclusive.
