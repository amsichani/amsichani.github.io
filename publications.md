Abstract<br/> <em>"This article approaches the social and cultural aspects of engaging with and communicatingC. P. Cavafy and his oeuvre in Web 2.0 platforms from an interdisciplinarypoint of view. By discussing the social web as a new discourse network, thearticle initially describes how the data architecture of the Web 2.0 ecology reconfigurescommunicative procedures, relations and roles towards a platformed sociality.It subsequently focuses on ways in which the transformation of the reader/userinto a content-producer may enrich the engagement with the Cavafian oeuvre.The notion of digi-formance is also proposed to describe the tropes that the usergeneratedcontent is communicated through Web 2.0 environments, inaugurating aparticipatory culture and practice based on notions of consumer production, remixand sharing. The article ends by further suggesting how the social web and digitalnetworking technologies could remodel literary sociality, in which the Cavafianoeuvre and scholarship are submerged, within the digital era."</em>

‘Read by ear’: literature and sound technologies during the Greek Long Sixties<br/><br/>

Abstract <br/><em>"Drawing on the recent (new) materialist turn within contemporary literary studies, thispaper aims to provide a critical study on the introduction of sound technologies in theGreek literary field during the Sixties (1958-1974), by pondering the intersections amongtechnological progress, mass culture, media devices, agents, and procedures in theliterary activity. Inaugurating an interdisciplinary approach between media history andGreek literary studies, and based on extensive archival research and on hithertounexplored cross-domain primary sources, my analysis will investigate how almosthiddenparameters in the literary history, such as sound technologies, enrich the literaryactivity with new material substrates, establish new forms of literacy and constituteinnovative discursive networks, beyond the printed word.Serialized novel readings over the airwaves, specialised radio-directing techniques(‘Cinemaphone’), adaptations, abridgements and dramatizations of literature flourishedon many specialised radio programs during the Sixties, in the midst of the golden age ofthe Greek Broadcasting. At the same time, the introduction and adoption of the (7-inch)45 rpm record format by the entire newly-established Greek record industry, as asmaller, more durable and higher-fidelity record standard, allow a series of experimentswith sound-recording technology in distributing verse. While record albums andmarketing labels (‘Dionysos’) with poetry readings by Elytis, Seferis and of Cavafy’sworksare introduced as a spin-off activity of publishing houses like Ikaros, these greatsoundingproducts of authorial voices, alongside the recordings of poems set to popularmusic, influence the popularity of Greek literature –both in Greece and abroad− whileepitomizing the decline of modernist divide between high and popular culture. Few yearslater, within a society accustomed to numerous media formats and well-trained inlistening, cultural resistance to the Colonels’ regime (1967-1974) was -among others-‘sonorous’: what ends the deafening silence of the majority of intellectuals is Seferis’declaration against the Junta’s regime (28 March 1969). That was a self-recorded andradio transmitted message, while a plethora of oral readings and poetry happeningssucceed to remediate the censored words.Ultimately, my paper aims to further explore how sound technologies force a widespreadinterest in the Greek public sphere towards the oral and the aural modes of perception,echoing their current international awareness towards the material and technologicalaspects of communication, including issues of secondary orality and new mediaecologies, as discussed by Marshall McLuhan and Claude Lévi-Strauss. Challengingconventional ways of thinking about the reading experience and its agents, these culturaltechnologies remodel the very conditions of literary communication, and accelerate themodernisation of the literary circuit as well as the commodification of its processes.
