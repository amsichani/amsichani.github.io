This article approaches the social and cultural aspects of engaging with and communicatingC. P. Cavafy and his oeuvre in Web 2.0 platforms from an interdisciplinarypoint of view. By discussing the social web as a new discourse network, thearticle initially describes how the data architecture of the Web 2.0 ecology reconfigurescommunicative procedures, relations and roles towards a platformed sociality.It subsequently focuses on ways in which the transformation of the reader/userinto a content-producer may enrich the engagement with the Cavafian oeuvre.The notion of digi-formance is also proposed to describe the tropes that the usergeneratedcontent is communicated through Web 2.0 environments, inaugurating aparticipatory culture and practice based on notions of consumer production, remixand sharing. The article ends by further suggesting how the social web and digitalnetworking technologies could remodel literary sociality, in which the Cavafianoeuvre and scholarship are submerged, within the digital era.
